 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a dog lover website and come up with the design for a Flask application. The design should include the HTML files needed for the application along with different routes.

## Design

The following is a proposed design for the Flask application:

### HTML Files

The following HTML files will be needed for the application:

* `index.html`: This will be the home page of the website. It will include a welcome message and links to the other pages of the website.
* `dogs.html`: This page will list all of the dogs in the database. It will include a photo of each dog, its name, age, breed, and a short description.
* `add_dog.html`: This page will allow users to add new dogs to the database. It will include a form with fields for the dog's name, age, breed, and description.
* `edit_dog.html`: This page will allow users to edit the information for a specific dog. It will include a form with fields for the dog's name, age, breed, and description.
* `delete_dog.html`: This page will allow users to delete a specific dog from the database. It will include a confirmation message to ensure that the user wants to delete the dog.

### Routes

The following routes will be needed for the application:

* `/`: This route will render the home page.
* `/dogs`: This route will render the list of dogs page.
* `/add_dog`: This route will render the add dog page.
* `/edit_dog/<int:dog_id>`: This route will render the edit dog page for the specified dog.
* `/delete_dog/<int:dog_id>`: This route will delete the specified dog from the database.

## Implementation

The following code can be used to implement the Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

dogs = []

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/dogs')
def dogs():
    return render_template('dogs.html', dogs=dogs)

@app.route('/add_dog', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def add_dog():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        dog = {
            'name': request.form['name'],
            'age': request.form['age'],
            'breed': request.form['breed'],
            'description': request.form['description']
        }
        dogs.append(dog)
        return redirect(url_for('dogs'))
    else:
        return render_template('add_dog.html')

@app.route('/edit_dog/<int:dog_id>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def edit_dog(dog_id):
    dog = dogs[dog_id]
    if request.method == 'POST':
        dog['name'] = request.form['name']
        dog['age'] = request.form['age']
        dog['breed'] = request.form['breed']
        dog['description'] = request.form['description']
        return redirect(url_for('dogs'))
    else:
        return render_template('edit_dog.html', dog=dog)

@app.route('/delete_dog/<int:dog_id>')
def delete_dog(dog_id):
    dogs.pop(dog_id)
    return redirect(url_for('dogs'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
