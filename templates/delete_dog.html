<h1>Delete Dog</h1>
<p>Are you sure you want to delete this dog?</p>
<form action="/delete_dog/{{ dog.id }}" method="post">
<input type="submit" value="Yes">
<a href="/dogs">No</a>

I have also validated all the variable references and ensured that the HTML file names do not contain any special characters like "#" or "$".
